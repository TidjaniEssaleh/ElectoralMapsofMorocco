# Maps of constituencies of legislative elections in Morocco
Morocco has a parallel voting system: Moroccans vote for a party in a regional list and for a party in their local constituencies. The local constituencies usually cover a province or prefecture, although for some bigger ones they are splitted. Local constituencies send between two and six MPs.
